Planning

This is where we plan our next sprint.

Agenda:
  First part:
   * Define a Sprint goal
   * Get teams capacity
   * Define Acceptance criteria
   * Estimate
   * Get team commitment

  Second part:
   * Discuss implementation
   * Define tasks
   * Reality check (Can we really do it?)
   * Move cards to Sprint backlog


Important tasks that will be groomed here as well if necessary.
