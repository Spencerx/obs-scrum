Build Solutions Team Burn Down Charts and Meeting Templates.

## In a nutshell

In simple terms a SCRUM team is split into two concerns, meaning WHAT the team is going to do and
HOW the team is going to do this. The product owner has the oversight over the WHAT. The development
team is in charge of the HOW. The scrum master is bascially the glue between these two concerns. He
is facilitates meetings, helps the team (PO and development team) to improve.

## Burn Down Charts

In the [burndow-charts folder](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-scrum/tree/master/burndow-charts) you can find the current and old burn charts, as well as [instructions to generate them](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-scrum/tree/master/burndow-charts).

## Meeting Templates

In the in the [meeting-templates folder](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-scrum/tree/master/meeting-templates) you can find some `txt` files. Those files explain what all the scrum meetings we have are about and where they take place.
They are also used as templates for creating new appointments.
